# MonoGame_ComponentSystem

Unity3D is the reference for this project.
I really love Unity3D, but sometimes I wished about only coding without the Editor.
So I decidede to make a component system like in Unity3D in MonoGame :)

With the source also comes an example project :)

I made this together with my firend Hyatukate.
